"THE RED-BULL LICENSE" (Revision 11):

<harsha@foobar.systems> wrote this code. As long as you retain this notice,
you can do whatever you want with this stuff. ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES ARE VOID. CONSEQUENTIALLY, I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES.
Heck, even I can't get this to run sometimes.
If we meet IRL, and you think this stuff is worth it,
you can buy me a Red Bull since I don't drink.
